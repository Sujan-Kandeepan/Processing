This repository contains the full source code for an assignment in MMEDIA 1A03,
an elective course which challenged students to program an interactive user
experience which was fun and fit a particular theme. This project was centered
around the playful nature of alphabet soup and mimicks the behaviour of adding
letters to soup bowls of various flavours to choose from, complete with a
heads-up display and other features.
